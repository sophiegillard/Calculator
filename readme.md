# The Project
I created a calculator using HTML, CSS and JS. 

It is a basic calculator with basic operators such as "+", "-", "/", "*" and "%".

## The process
I created all the html part in JS. 
I created the divs and the spans manually and then all the inputs/buttons are created with a loop. I gave a value to each input so that each buttons can directly take this value in the calculator.

I organized the divs to make it easier to handle the flex boxes.

Each buttons work. 

If you push on AC. All the current calcul is erased. If you press Backspace only the last digit is erased. 

I created a history too.

## Issues
I still have issues to have a correct design in the mobile view as the flexboxes are not efficient.

The history is not done. I would like to add a button on the left top corner to erase the history.
